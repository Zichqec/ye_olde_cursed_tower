	0:I think you may have some misunderstanding of what it means to combat a dragon.
	1:... Okaaay...
	0:Most dragons do not possess the intelligence to be more of a threat to man than any large predator.
	1:Wait, then the old{br}'knight slays a dragon' clich√© is made up!?
	0:Not entirely. Those that do possess notable intelligence often become violent tyrants, uncontrolled by the lord whose lands they reside within. Lords do not care for the competition.

	0:Yes.
	1:Not really. I have a job, though. Or... had a job...
	0:... What sort?
	1:... Uh. Right. I was doing clerical work. Making phonecalls, managing files, moving memos to where they were supposed to be, that sort of thing. Everything you need for the rest of the office to run smoothly.

	0:Part of the duties of a knight is to manage the estates under their care. It isn't unheard of for an act of nature to be interpreted as a misstep of those in power.
	1:That sounds like some kind of conspiracy nonsense...
	0:Correct.
	1:Wait, there were conspiracy theorists way back then!?
	0:There is little more indicative of human nature than coming up with strange explanations for mundane events.

	1:\b[4]Sooo... What kind of stuff did you do in your free time?
	0:\b[4]Ah. I spent a fair amount of time at balls, festivals, and hunts. However, I would not call any of it 'free time', as a strong social standing is required to maintain good will.
	1:You mean you never picked up any hobbies just for the fun of it?
	0:Indeed not. And yourself?

	0:Those that make a collection of the lives of others have ever been beyond my understanding. Our wizard is far from the first to do so, and will be far from the last.

	0:Nor do I.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	1:\b[2]What actually happened for you to,{br}uh... end up like this?
	0:\b[4]Ah. I was attending to my duties as a protector of the{br}lord's lands. There had been numerous reports of people going missing in recent years. Many of which were said to have gone to the wizard to seek assistance in some matter before their disappearances.
	1:Oh no...
	0:Indeed. The wizard did not care for anyone probing into what was taking place in this tower. I was prepared for the possibility that I might be combating the arcane, but the wizard was equally prepared for our confrontation and came out the victor.
	1:... And you ended up like this?
	0:I did.

	0:\b[4]It can be a lovely place, but no, I believe it too dangerous to 'like' it.

	1:Oh! I don't mean out in the waters, I mean, like... hanging out on the sand, maybe digging some holes, looking for sea shells...
	0:...? I suppose it isn't unusual for people to gather along the shore, but that isn't work that I've done, no.
	1:Uhm... alright. Well!{br}I think it's nice. I like making a hollow in the sand, with a trench for the water to flood in. It's a great way to take a nap. As long as you don't sleep so long you get burnt...

	0:\b[4]An all-nighter, is it?
	1:Yeah! Like when you stay up allll night and don't sleep at all?
	0:I've had to do that on occasion. It is not pleasant, but it is an essential skill.
	1:I totally agree. I did it sometimes in high school. I always regretted it the next day...
	0:Regret? You had a choice in the matter?
	1:Well, yeah. I mostly stayed up on nights where I snuck out of the house to, uh... hang out with my friends...
	0:... I feel there may be more to this story.

}

talk RandomTalk
{
	1:\b[4]I wonder what it's like to be a bird.
	0:\b[0]To fly?
	1:No, to have feathers and a beak and those weird claw feet. Like, if I turned into a bird right now, would I have the instinct to make a nest? Or is that something they learn from their bird-parents?
	0:I... don't know, truthfully.
	1:I bet the urge to do it is instinct, but unless your bird-parents show you how, you're really, really bad at it.
	0:Perhaps...
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	0:\b[4]Were you evaluated for arcane potential when you were young?
	1:\b[4]Yeah, actually! My parents had me tested when I was 3 or 4 years old? Apparently some of their belongings kept ending up under my bed, even ones they made sure to put high up in places there was no way I could reach them. That made them suspect I might be doing something when they weren't looking.
	0:And were you?
	1:I wish. I basically have no capacity to make use of my mana whatsoever. It turns out we had a well-meaning brownie in the house that got a little confused about where things are supposed to go because my dad stuffed all my toys under my bed a few too many times... Those things love cleaning, and if they see where you put things to tidy up enough times, well...
	0:... They try to put them where you want them. I see. That is... rather adorable.
	1:Right!? I bet it was a baby brownie... still learning how terrible we are at keeping organized.
	0:Heh. Indeed.

	0:\b[2]Feeling chilled again?

	1:... Yeah, maybe.
}

{
	1:\b[4]Can you feel your {toes}?
	0:\b[2]...? Not in particular, no.

	1:Yeah, usually. Every spring and fall it gets bad, I get sneezy and my eyes water. But now I don't even \f[italic,1]have\f[italic,default] eyes or a nose!

}

{
	1:\b[2]If I can just wiggle a little further...
	0:\b[0]You may knock yourself off the table.
	1:Oh, true... But,{br}that's a small price to pay for science!

}

	1:\b[4]What do you think the wizard is doing?
	0:\b[4]Keeping us hostage.
	1:No, no, not that... I mean, like, right now. The wizard is here, right? So like...{br}what kinds of things does a wizard do?
	0:Is there a point in speculating?
	1:It helps keep the boredom at bay...
	0:I see. Perhaps the wizard is reading from an ancient tome or scroll, or writing new ones.
	1:Ohh... fancy magic stuff!
	0:Yes, the very same{br}"fancy magic stuff" that has us trapped here.
	1:Right...
	0:Besides the obvious, I imagine wizards likely have to keep up with the same basic needs as the rest of us. Food, water, sleep.
	1:Sleep... You mean the wizard might be asleep right now, and we wouldn't even know it!?
	0:It is possible, yes. We can't be certain of it though, so best to speak as though we are being listened to.
	1:Yeah...
}

talk RandomTalk

	1:\b[2]I think there's a bug on me!
