	0:I think you may have some misunderstanding of what it means to combat a dragon.

	0:Most dragons do not possess the intelligence to be more of a threat to man than any large predator.
	1:Wait, then the old{br}'knight slays a dragon' cliché is made up!?
	0:Not entirely. Those that do possess notable intelligence often become violent tyrants, uncontrolled by the lord whose lands they reside within. Lords do not care for the competition.

	0:Yes.
	1:Not really. I have a job, though. Or... had a job...

	1:Oh no...
	0:Indeed. The wizard did not care for anyone probing into what was taking place in this tower. I was prepared for the possibility that I might be combating the arcane, but the wizard was equally prepared for our confrontation and came out the victor.

	0:I've had to do that on occasion. It is not pleasant, but it is an essential skill.

	1:\b[4]Yeah, actually! My parents had me tested when I was 3 or 4 years old? Apparently some of their belongings kept ending up under my bed, even ones they made sure to put high up in places there was no way I could reach them. That made them suspect I might be doing something when they weren't looking.
	0:And were you?
	1:I wish. I basically have no capacity to make use of my mana whatsoever. It turns out we had a well-meaning brownie in the house that got a little confused about where things are supposed to go because my dad stuffed all my toys under my bed a few too many times... Those things love cleaning, and if they see where you put things to tidy up enough times, well...
	0:... They try to put them where you want them. I see. That is... rather adorable.

	0:Is there a point in speculating?
	1:It helps keep the boredom at bay...

	1:Ohh... fancy magic stuff!
	0:Yes, the very same{br}"fancy magic stuff" that has us trapped here.
	1:Right...
	0:Besides the obvious, I imagine wizards likely have to keep up with the same basic needs as the rest of us. Food, water, sleep.
	1:Sleep... You mean the wizard might be asleep right now, and we wouldn't even know it!?
