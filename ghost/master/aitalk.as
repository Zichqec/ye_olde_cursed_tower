	1:\b[2]Sooo... You're from, like, knightly times, right?
	0:\b[4]The knighthood is an honor that persists to this day.
	1:Wait, really!?
	0:Yes.
	1:How do you know!?
	0:Within the past {tenday}, the wizard's looking glass has become prison to a knight of the current age.
	1:... Oh... Are they nice?
	0:They are not.
	1:...... oh ......

	1:\b[4]Have you ever fought a dragon?
	0:\b[4]Why would I have?
	1:Oh, uhm... I... don't know? That's just a thing that knights do, isn't it?
	0:I think you may have some misunderstanding of what it means to combat a dragon.
	1:... Okaaay...
	0:Most dragons do not possess the intelligence to be more of a threat to man than any large predator.
	1:Wait, then the old 'knight slays a dragon' cliché is made up!?
	0:Not entirely. Those that do possess notable intelligence often become violent tyrants, uncontrolled by the lord whose lands they reside within. Lords do not care for the competition.
	1:... Yeah, that... that makes sense, actually...

	0:\b[4]You seem old enough to be ending your apprenticeship soon, if you haven't done so already. Did you have a guild in mind?
	1:\b[4]Apprenticeship? With a guild? You mean, like, do I have my career planned?
	0:Yes.
	1:Not really. I have a job, though. Or... had a job...
	0:... What sort?
	1:... Uh. Right. I was doing clerical work. Making phonecalls, managing files, moving memos to where they were supposed to be, that sort of thing. Everything you need for the rest of the office to run smoothly.
	0:Ah. It seems you've had a thorough education, then. I'm not surprised.
	1:Thank... you...?
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	0:\b[4]This is not the first time I've suffered a curse.
	1:\b[2]Really? What happened?
	0:Part of the duties of a knight is to manage the estates under their care. It isn't unheard of for an act of nature to be interpreted as a misstep of those in power.
	1:That sounds like some kind of conspiracy nonsense...
	0:Correct.
	1:Wait, there were conspiracy theorists way back then!?
	0:There is little more indicative of human nature than coming up with strange explanations for mundane events.

	1:\b[2]How many sunsets do you think you've watched in your life?
	0:\b[2]A strange question...
	1:I'm just curious!
	0:I suppose it would have been several thousand. I've never thought about it.
	1:Oh, same! I've seen about 7,318.
	0:That is... specific.
	1:Give or take a few dozen.
	0:You've counted them?
	1:Of course!

	1:\b[2]Hehehehe...
	0:\b[0]Is something funny?
	1:I was just thinking that if you were put into a lightbulb, you'd be a nightlight...
	0:...
	1:You know... because you're a knight... and you would be a light...?
	0:Heh. That is funny.
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	1:\b[4]Sooo... What kind of stuff did you do in your free time?
	0:\b[4]Ah. I spent a fair amount of time at balls, festivals, and hunts. However, I would not call any of it 'free time', as a strong social standing is required to maintain good will.
	1:You mean you never picked up any hobbies just for the fun of it?
	0:Indeed not. And yourself?
	1:Oh, I like reading and listening to music! And roller skating is fun. And making string art!
	0:Quite the polymath. I'm impressed.
	1:Heheh... Thanks!

	0:\b[2]Do you have any favorite foods?
	1:\b[4]Like food-foods, or like snack-foods, or like any-foods?
	0:... For meals.
	1:Food-foods! Okay. Yeah. I've always liked peach and garlic chicken.
	0:I see we are both compelled by fowl.
	1:We are?
	0:Yes. I'm fond of roast pheasant.
	1:Wow. We're basically twins!

	1:\b[4]I don't miss getting hungry, but it's strange still getting cravings...
	0:\b[2]You have something in mind that you want?
	1:Something sweet! I was taking a break from sugar when all of... this... happened, but I regret it now! I should have let my teeth rot out!
	0:I see. I understand what you mean. I would not mind a calisson or two.
	1:Right!? I really, really, really want a strawberry pretzel tart!
	0:Alas...
	1:Alas!

	0:\b[4]You've mentioned that you have an elder sister?
	1:\b[4]I do! Are you curious about something?
	0:Whether or not you had other siblings as well.
	1:No, it's just the two of us. Though, you remind me of her sometimes!
	0:Do I?
	1:Well... Not in tone, or attitude, or interests... but you both have a similar sense of humor!
	0:I'm quite flattered that you think I have one at all.

talk RandomTalk
{
	1:\b[4]Did you have any pets? As a kid, or before all of this, whatever.
	0:\b[2]In a way. I had a horse that I raised and trained by hand. He served me well in combat.
	1:Combat, sure... I had an ant farm, and when I was younger, my family had a dog.
	0:Ah, my family also had dogs. They kept our home entertaining.
	1:Yeah, right? I wouldn't mind getting a puppy once we're out of here.
	0:... I hope you do.

	1:\b[2]... I was wondering...
	0:\b[0]Yes?
	1:Do you know what happens if the wizard... doesn't want us anymore?
	0:...
	1:Will we be let out, do you think?
	0:... No. I don't think we will.
	1:...... oh......
}

talk RandomTalk
{
	1:\b[2]You had music back in your day, right? I mean, who didn't?
	0:\b[2]Heh. Yes, we did. There was a ballade I had a particular fondness for, of a seven-headed snake.
	1:That seems like too many heads, to be honest.
	0:The heads were not truly heads, as the snake was not truly a snake.
	1:... Yeah, that's how art is, huh.

talk RandomTalk
{
	0:\b[2]I am curious about something, if it isn't too forward of me to ask.
	1:\b[2]Oh, no, I'm sure it's fine. Shoot!
	0:Did you have plans for your future?
	1:Uh... I don't know, the usual things, I think? Finish college, get a nice job, buy a house eventually.
	0:A comfortable life, then. That's an admirable goal.
	1:Yeah, uh... Yeah. I guess it is.
