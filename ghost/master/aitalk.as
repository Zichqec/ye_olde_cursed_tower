	1:\b[2]Sooo... You're from, like, knightly times, right?
	0:\b[4]The knighthood is an honor that persists to this day.
	1:Wait, really!?
	0:Yes.
	1:How do you know!?
	0:Within the past {tenday}, the wizard's looking glass has become prison to a knight of the current age.
	1:... Oh... Are they nice?
	0:They are not.
	1:...... oh ......

	1:\b[2]Have you ever fought a dragon?
	0:\b[4]Why would I have?
	1:Oh, uhm... I... don't know? That's just a thing that knights do, isn't it?
	0:I think you may have some misunderstanding of what it means to combat a dragon.
	1:... Okaaay...
	0:Most dragons do not possess the intelligence to be more of a threat to man than any large predator.
	1:Wait, then the old 'knight slays a dragon' cliché is made up!?
	0:Not entirely. Those that do possess notable intelligence often become violent tyrants, uncontrolled by the lord whose lands they reside within. Lords do not care for the competition.
	1:... Yeah, that... that makes sense, actually...

	0:\b[4]You seem old enough to be ending your apprenticeship soon, if you haven't done so already. Did you have a guild in mind?
	1:\b[4]Apprenticeship? With a guild? You mean, like, do I have my career planned?
	0:Yes.
	1:Not really. I have a job, though. Or... had a job...
	0:... What sort?
	1:... Uh. Right. I was doing clerical work. Making phonecalls, managing files, moving memos to where they were supposed to be, that sort of thing. Everything you need for the rest of the office to run smoothly.
	0:Ah. It seems you've had a thorough education, then. I'm not surprised.
	1:Thank... you...?

	0:\b[4]This is not the first time I've suffered a curse.
	1:\b[2]Really? What happened?
	0:Part of the duties of a knight is to manage the estates under their care. It isn't unheard of for an act of nature to be interpreted as a misstep of those in power.
	1:That sounds like some kind of conspiracy nonsense...
	0:Correct.
	1:Wait, there were conspiracy theorists way back then!?
	0:There is little more indicative of human nature than coming up with strange explanations for mundane events.

	1:\b[2]How many sunsets do you think you've watched in your life?
	0:\b[2]A strange question...
	1:I'm just curious!
	0:I suppose it would have been several thousand. I've never thought about it.
	1:Oh, same! I've seen about 7,318.
	0:That is... specific.
	1:Give or take a few dozen.
	0:You've counted them?
	1:Of course!

	1:\b[2]Hehehehe...
	0:Is something funny?
	1:I was just thinking that if you were put into a lightbulb, you'd be a nightlight...
	0:...
	1:You know... because you're a knight... and you would be a light...?
	0:Heh. That is funny.
